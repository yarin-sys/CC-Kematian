## Disclaimer
To run this project, you must use Python 3.10, as TenSEAL is only compatible with that version.  
Python 3.11 or above is not supported by TenSEAL, and attempting to install or run TenSEAL with newer Python versions will result in compatibility errors.  
Additionally, do not run this project using PowerShell â€” it is recommended to use WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux), preferably Debian. Some dependencies (e.g., NumPy for Linux) may not function correctly in PowerShell or Command Prompt environments.
